# R6-Loadout-Randomizer
### A simple R6-wiki parser and loadout randomizer written in python. 
I wanted to practice some python so why not make something related to one of my favourite games, so I decided to make a small loadout 
randomizer for Siege. It uses the BeautifulSoup module to parse the data it needs from [The R6 wiki](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/) 
and python's inbuilt JSON module to save the operator data to a JSON file.

## To do
- Add a GUI
- Make it possible to randomize multiple operators for a specific game mode
- Add filtering options for the randomization
- Make recruit work in all his glory
